1. What is React JS and what problems does it solve? Support your answer with concepts introduced in class and from your personal research on the web.
    ReactJS is a library to build user interfaces that have components that can change frequently over time, like data in APIs

1. Describe component state.
    The "state" is an object where property values are stored and that determines how the componet renders.

1. Describe props.
    React properties are arguments passed in to components and - similar to attributes in HTML - they can be used to customize components.

1. What are side effects, and how do you sync effects in a React component to changes of certain state or props?
    Side effects, using the effect hook: useEffect, address anything outside the current function, like the API requests we've been learning this week.
